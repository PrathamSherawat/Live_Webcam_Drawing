Live Webcam Drawing with OpenCV
This project demonstrates how to draw the movement of objects captured by a webcam in real-time using OpenCV in Python.

Overview
The program captures video input from the webcam and tracks the movement of objects based on predefined color ranges. It then draws contours around the moving objects and displays the live drawing on the screen.
